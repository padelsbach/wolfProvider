# WolfProvider Debian Packaging
This is the flow for building and installing 

## Local build

From the repo root, run the following command:
```
./scripts/build-wolfprovider.sh --debian
```

For a FIPS build, run the following:
```
./scripts/build-wolfprovider.sh --debian --enable-fips
```

The Debian packages are placed in the parent directory, which should be one level above the repo root.

## CI build
Instead of doing a local build as outlined above, we can alternatively use packages generated from CI.

To use a build from CI for local install, download the artifacts from the Debian CI job. Then install the .deb's from the zip file with `apt` as shown below rather than from the build.

## Install

If not already done, install the WolfSSL Debian package. The non-FIPS version is available in this repo and is installed by the script below. This step is only needed once, and can be done prior to the `build-wolfprovider.sh` step above.
```
./debian/install-wolfssl.sh ./.github/packages/debian-wolfssl.tar.gz
```

For the script above, some systems may require additional packages:
```
apt install build-essential devscripts dh-exec
```

### Optionally install custom OpenSSL

**Important**: before proceeding with the wolfProvider install, make sure packages are not present:
```
apt purge -y libwolfprov ; apt purge -y openssl-config ; apt purge -y openssl ; apt purge -y libssl3
```

Get the system architecture which determines the library paths for the following steps:
```
export CURRENT_ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
```

Then install the wolfProvider-specific OpenSSL. From the repo root:
```
apt install ../openssl*${CURRENT_ARCH}*.deb ../libssl3*${CURRENT_ARCH}*.deb
```

Check that the provider API is disabled since wolfProvider is not installed:
```
$ openssl list -providers
Could not load libwolfprov.so. Is the libwolfprov package installed?
  libwolfprov.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

### Install wolfProvider

Then install wolfProvider:
```
apt install ../libwolfprov*${CURRENT_ARCH}*.deb
```

Confirm that wolfProvider is installed:
```
$ openssl list -providers
```

Output should look like this:
```
Providers:
  default
    name: wolfSSL Provider
    version: 1.0.2
    status: active
```

## Release process
Always use CI to perform the release build to avoid potential errors from building locally.

* Tag the wolfProvider repo in the format `vX.Y.Z`
  * The changelog is generated by the Debian scripts
* Run the Debian job in CI
* Download the artifacts zip file which contains the .deb's
* Generate release archives as needed
